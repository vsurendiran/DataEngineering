    print("Missing Values:\n", missing_values)

    # Check for duplicates
    duplicates = df.duplicated().sum()
    print("Duplicates:\n", duplicates)

    # Validate data types
    for column in df.columns:
        if df[column].dtype == 'object':
            # Check for non-numeric values in numeric columns
            if column in ['age', 'salary']:  # Example numeric columns
                invalid_values = df[~df[column].str.isnumeric()]
                print(f"Invalid values in {column}:\n", invalid_values)

    # Apply custom validation rules
    invalid_age = df[(df['age'] < 0) | (df['age'] > 120)]
    print("Invalid Age Values:\n", invalid_age)

# Validate data
validate_data(data)

# Clean data
data = data.drop_duplicates()
data = data.dropna()

# Save cleaned data
data.to_csv('cleaned_data.csv', index=False)
```
